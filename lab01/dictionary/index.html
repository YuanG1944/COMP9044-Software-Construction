There is a template file named <code>dictionary_answers.txt</code> which you must use
to enter the answers for this exercise.
<p>
{{copy_a_file("dictionary_answers.txt")}}

The autotest scripts depend on the format of <code>dictionary_answers.txt</code> so just add your answers
don't otherwise change the file.  In other words edit <code>dictionary_answers.txt</code>:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">gedit dictionary_answers.txt &amp;</kbd>
</pre>

On most Unix systems you will find one or more dictionaries containing many thousands of
words typically in the directories <code>/usr/share/dict/</code>.
<p>
We've created  a dictionary named <code>dictionary.txt</code> for this lab exercise.
<p>
{{copy_a_file("dictionary.txt")}}
{{execute("ls -l")}}

<ol>
<li>

Write an egrep command  that prints  the words in <code>dictionary.txt</code>
which contain in characters "lmn" consecutively.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print:
{{execute("egrep 'lmn' dictionary.txt", show_command=False)}}
<p>
<div></div>

The {{course_code}} class account contains a script named <b>autotest</b>
that automatically runs 1 or more tests on your lab exercises.
Once you have entered you answer for q1 you can check it like this:

<pre class="command_line">
<kbd class="shell">{{course_number}} autotest {{name}} q1</kbd>
Test q1 (egrep '^Q1 answer' dictionary_answers.txt|tail -1|sed 's/.*answer[: ]*//'|sh) - passed
1 tests passed 0 tests failed
</pre>

Passing the autotest doesn't guarantee your answer is correct, of course, but
it may find a mistake you've missed so run autotest for each of the following questions
when you've entered the answer in <code>dictionary_answers.txt</code>.

<li>

Write a shell pipeline  that prints the words that contain "zz", but do not end in apostrophe-s ('s)?
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print:

{{execute("egrep 'zz' dictionary.txt | egrep -v \"'s$\"", height="12em", show_command=False)}}


<div></div>
<li>

Write an egrep command that prints the words that contain four consecutive vowels?
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print these words:

{{execute("egrep '[aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU][aeiouAEIOU]' dictionary.txt", height="12em", show_command=False)}}

<div></div>
<li>
Write an egrep command that prints words which contain all 5 vowels "aeiou" in that order?
<p>
The words may contain more than 5 vowels but they must contain "aeiou" in that order.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print these words:

{{execute("egrep -i 'a.*e.*i.*o.*u' dictionary.txt", height="12em", show_command=False)}}

<div></div>
<li>
Write an egrep command that prints which contain the vowels "aeiou" in that order
and no other vowels.
<p>
<b>Hint</b>:  it should print these words:

{{execute("egrep -i '^[^aeiou]*a[^aeiou]*e[^aeiou]*i[^aeiou]*o[^aeiou]*u[^aeiou]*$' dictionary.txt", show_command=False)}}

<div></div>
